I am Alok Kumar, a multifaceted human being whose interests in a variety of things keeps increasing everyday.
Alokation is my online identity and my self-branding. I have been interested in all kinds of things from childhood. It’s not one thing that can contain myself completely.
But to just make it more clear here are my current favourites

**UX** (It has been and it will be the biggest game changer)

**Design** Thinking (I think in design and strategize)

**Frontend (Web & UI) Development** (It has been my strongest dev skill ever)

**Coding** (Thing that keeps my brain alive, Actually I believe Coding is an Art)

**Ar**t (My passion and my friend from childhood)

**Thinking** (Fodder for my brain)

**Music** (One thing which can mix with all other passions)

**Writing** (I just love it. When spoken words fail it is time to write and fight)

**Poetry** (At one point I was a poet. Hopefully I can revive it again someday)

**Singing** (Did I mention my name as Kishore Kumar 😜

Well I place myself somewhere surely above a bathroom singer but not confident enough for a public audience)

**Gaming** (No I am not a pro but the race is still on)

And here are few which now takes a back-seat

Backend Development

Server & Networking

Cyber Security

Computer Hardware

Electronics

Robotics
